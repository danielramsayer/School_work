Module 1
    We went over a variety of perspectives and experiences of several developers to understand how the base of the internet works and how those technical blocks build up to the technology we have today. 

    Protocols to be aware of
        HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocols -
        
        TCP - Transmission Control Protocol -
        
        DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - is used to assign your         computer an IP address.
        
        UDP - User Datagram Protocol - 
        
        DNS - Domain Name System Protocol - When you visit a website like meta.com, your computer uses the Domain Name System (DNS) to find the corresponding IP address. It queries a DNS server, which returns the correct IP so your browser can connect to the site.
        
        IMAP - Internet Message Access Protocol - download emails and manage your mailbox on the server storing your emails. This is the purpose of the Internet Message Access Protocol or IMAP.
        
        SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - It allows email clients to submit emails for sending via an SMTP server. You can also use it to receive emails from an email client, but IMAP is more commonly used.

        POP - Post Office Protocol - is an older protocol used to download emails to an email client. The main difference in using POP instead of IMAP is that POP will delete the emails on the server once they have been downloaded to your local device.
        
        FTP - File Transfer Protocol - The transfer protocol from a client to a server that is potentially observable by third parties.
        
        SSH - Secure Shell Protocol - Using an SSH client allows you to connect to an SSH server running on a server to perform commands on the remote computer.
        All data sent over SSH is encrypted. This means that third parties cannot understand the data transmitted. Only the sending and receiving computers can understand the data.
        
        SFTP - Secure File Transfer Protocol - The transfer protocol from a client to a server that is not easily observable by third parties.
