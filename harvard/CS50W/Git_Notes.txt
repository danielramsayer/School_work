Lecture One: HTML, CSS and SCSS
    We went over the basic HTML format of websites. We went over the most common HTML features: html, head, title, body, h-1 thru h-6, p, br, a, img, style="property:value;", <!-- -->, em, b, br.
    CSS is the style component and Sass is a superset of CSS with programming elements added to the language to allow for greater diversity of action. It requires compilation to be functional uses.
